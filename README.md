## Why modifications in this plugin?

I have found several logical errors in this plugin that was conflicting with other plugins or breaking things in some of the websites that I was working on. I have to fix these issues after each update so I decided to setup the repo for this plugin and after each update I manually check the changes and add them in my modified version.

Also, I like plugins to have proper documentations with PHP DOC Tag and Code should be WPCS validated which this plugin doesn't have, So made all the fixes to make the plugin better.

> Note for author: I am not copying and selling this plugin, I tried to reach support to get these issues fixed but the support didn't help very much, so I decided to fix these issues on my own. I would love if author also fix this issues in future so that i won't need to manage this repositary. Thanks.
